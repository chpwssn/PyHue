Configuring (eventually this will be automated again):

To get started, follow the setup instructions on your Hue station then get a username by following 

    http://www.developers.meethue.com/documentation/getting-started
    
Copy `config.example.json` to `config.json` and edit appropriately. You can then run `python3 example.py`.

This library does require `requests` which you can install by following the directions at http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/ or by running `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
